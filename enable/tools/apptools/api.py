Enable Apptools Integration
===========================

Apptools (https://github.com/enthought/apptools) is a library of useful code
for building GUI applications.  It includes code for features like preferences,
undo/redo support, and seelction management.

The code in this sub-package helps applications interface with the
functionality provided by Apptools, but is optional from the point of view
of the Enable codebase as a whole.
