comparator.py will show a suite of SVG images side by side with pngs for the
purpose of testing compliance. Currently the app will show the wx backend, the
kiva backend, and the reference png. The use of wx here does not imply wx is
required to use Savage, but it is obviously needed to compare the wx backend.
