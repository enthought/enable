Enable 4.4.0 (May 1, 2014)
==========================

Enhancements
------------

 * Added a test assistant to aid in writing unit tests for Enable/Chaco code (3cb6d22 & a5b8cb9)
 * Added Drag & Drop support for Qt (4196bc8)
 * Added a context menu tool (0c27475)

Fixes
-----

 * PR #92: Fixed the example support code to allow Chaco demos to run on Qt
 * PR #94: Fixed the examples so that they would run on Qt
 * PR #102: Fixed a transparency drawing bug in the Qt image backend

    #105, #110, #113)
 * PR #107: Fixed a memory leak in the QPainter kiva backend

Enable 3.4.1 (March 3, 2011)
============================

Fixes
-----

* Removed OnPaint method from KivaRenderPanel in savage. On Windows there
  were competing handlers for the paint event. The OnPaint method expected a
  certain order, which varied by Platform
* QImage constructor args were changed to use QByteArray to match changes to
  PySide API changes in PySide RC1


Enable 3.4.0 (Jan 26, 2011)
===========================

Enhancements
------------

* Major refactor of kiva backends to make setting the desired backend more resilient and flexible.
* Added support for PySide
* Qt backend no longer uses Agg internally, instead it uses QPainter.
* Improved gradient support in Quartz backend
* Improved cairo backend
* Updated to use variation of rev 8713 of matplotlib font_manager.py

Fixes
-----
* Fixed cubic spline rendering in OpenGl backend
* Fixed gradients using relative coordinates
* Fixed object-space gradients


Enable 3.3.2 (October 15, 2010)
===============================

Enhancements
------------

* Context manager methods were added to the Kiva GraphicsContext class, so
  now, instead of this common pattern for a GraphicsContext gc:

      gc.save_state()
      try:
          # Do stuff with gc...
      except:
          gc.restore_state()

  one can do this::

      with gc:
          # Do stuff with gc...

* Stacked layout containers were added.
* qt4_backend: Added Tony Yu's patch to better handling keypresses in Qt4 when modifier keys are pressed (r25644).
* vtk_backend: Added John Wiggins patch which adds key bindings to EnableVTKWindow (r25796).
* The Kiva backend for the Mac, implemented in ABCGI.pyx, is now processed with cython instead of pyrex.


Fixes
-----

* vtk_backend: Got rid of timer that was causing performance problems on
  the Mac by looking for the "StartEvent" on the RenderWindow to determine
  when we are about to do a vtk render. (r25605)
* savage:  Avoid the wx-specific FileInspector in Sike and use the
  CodeEditor directly. (r25742)
* Exceptions were updated to use the new Exception classes in several places.


Enable 3.3.1 (Feb 24, 2010)
===============================

Enhancements
------------

* Added dimming mask to disabled buttons when using wx backend (r25405).
* Added toggle_label and toggle_tooltip from Brad Buran's patch (r25414).
* vtk_backend: Made _redraw call _paint to force an immediate draw.
  Added a request_render callable slot that will be called instead of
  self.control.render if set. This allows renders to be coordinated to
  avoid duplicate renders. (r25423)
* Added option of making center section of compass clickable by setting
  "enable_center" to True. (r25492)
* kiva agg backend: fixed minor issues causing compiler warnings (r25498)

Fixes
-----

* Fixed hover_tool so it imports correctly under the 'null' toolkit, as
  reported on mailing list (r25407).


Enable 3.3.0 (Feb 24, 2010)
===========================

Enhancements
------------

 * Updated freetype to 2.3.12.  This makes our text look prettier, and also fixes some compatibility issues with OS X 10.6.
 * Moved Shape from examples into enable.primitives
 * Improved ability to find the Qt SVG IconEngine for the SVGButtonEditor
 * Improved painting in Wx by as much as 30%
 * Added repeat and reflect gradient fill methods

Fixes
-----

 * Fixed diamond marker to use the native Agg marker
 * Fixed drawing elliptical curves on OS X
 * Fixed scaling transforms affecting gradients
 * Fixed the "window" property on Enable components to recurse up their container hierarchy to return the default window associated with a component.
 * Viewports now correctly implement is_in() and components_at(), taking their own boundaries into account.
 * Removed explicit dependency on TraitsBackendWx in Enable
 * Fixing logic in enable.example_support, so that it no longer just uses wx if wxPython is installed, but rather looks at ETSConfig.toolkit.
 * Fixing some math in the computation of setting outer_x2 and outer_y2 attributes of components.

One final note is that the "enable2" legacy backwards compatibility package will
be removed by the next release.  If you have any code that imports from
"enable2" and the DeprecationWarnings haven't been sufficiently
motivating thus far, please heed them and change your imports to use
"enable"!


Enable 3.2.0 (July 15th, 2009)
==============================

enable Enhancements
-----------------------------

 * Added Slider and Compass widgets
 * Added an OverlayContainer (almost identical to the one in Chaco)
 * Added ImageGraphicsContextEnable class so that one can always import a Kiva Image backend-based GraphicsContextEnable
 * renaming marker_trait to MarkerTrait (the old name is still permitted forbackwards compatibility, but should be avoided)
 * Moved the scatter_markers module from Chaco to Enable, so that Enable components can use MarkerTrait
 * Added an experimental VTK backend for Enable, along with an example
 * Changed SVGButtonEditor toggle to draw a SVG under the button SVG instead of drawing a plain box
 * Added labels for SVGButton
 * Improving backbuffering performance on the Mac by creating the layer context from the window context instead of from a bitmap.
 * Adding a "fixed_preferred_size" trait to Components, so that relative size preferences can be expressed amongst different components in a container


enable Fixes
----------------------

 * Improved the backend selection to match the Traits UI backend unless ETSConfig.enable_toolkit is explicitly set
 * Fixed demo_main() in example_support.py so that it doesn't crash IPython
 * Fixed RGBAColorTrait so it can be used with the null toolkit
 * Changed the "sys_window" color to be the same as the Traits UI "WindowColor" constant
 * Fixed backend_cairo's get_text_extent() implementation to match other backends

kiva Fixes
--------------------
